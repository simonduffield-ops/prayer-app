                <p><strong>Consolation:</strong> Moments when your soul is drawn toward God - feelings of peace, joy, hope, faith, and charity that orient you toward love of God and neighbor.</p>
                <p><strong>Desolation:</strong> Moments that pull you away from God - spiritual dryness, darkness, agitation, or movement toward earthly things and self-absorption.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><em>By discerning these movements, you learn to recognize God's voice and resist what draws you away from Him.</em></p>
