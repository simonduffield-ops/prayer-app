I commit my life afresh to you this day and submit to the Lordship of Jesus.</p>

                        <p>Help me to walk in your light, that I may please you in every way, and bear fruit in every good work.</p>	
                        <p>Help me to give myself away to others, being kind to everyone I meet, loving the lost, and proclaiming Christ in all I do and say.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Father, I bind my will to your will, obligating it to your plans and purposes for me.</p>

                        <p>I bind my mind to the mind of Jesus so I can hear your thoughts in my thoughts.</p>

                        <p>I bind my emotions to the healing balm and comfort of the Holy Spirit.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>I loose, smash, crush and destroy all the wrong beliefs, wrong attitudes, excuses, deception and denial that my soul has been holding onto. I loose the effects and influences any wrong words spoken about me or to me and I loose the works of the enemy from me.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Help me to be aware of you and your love throughout this day.</p>
